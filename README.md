# Governor Suggester
Governor Suggester is an Android application that can analyze and trace a profile based on the device's resources usage and suggest the CPU Governor that presents the best performance and energy efficiency.
The application needs to have Root Access, so that it can read and parse dumpsys logs and trace a profile of the resources usage since the phone was last charged.
